## 👨🏻‍💻 Build a K8S Cluster

- 🔵 Created 3️⃣ Servers
    - Server 1 - Kube Master
    - Server 2 - Kube Node 1
    - Server 3 - Kube Node 2
- 🔴 Installed Docker
    - Docker is the container runtime that we will be using.
    - A container runtime is the software that actually runs the containers. K8S supports several other container runtimes.
    - To see the commands for installing Dcoker check file "install_docker.sh"
- 🟡 Installed Kubeadm Kubelet, and Kubectl
    - Need to install three things on each of our servers include Docker:
        - Kubeadm: This is a tool which automates a large portion of the process of setting up a cluster, it will make our job much easier.
        - Kubelet: The essential components of k8s that handles running containers on a node, every server that will be running containers needs kubelet
        - Kubectl: Command-line tool for interacting with cluster once it is up, we will use it to manage the cluster.
        - To see the commands for installing k8s components check file "install_k8s_components.sh"
- 🟢 Bootstrapping the Cluster
    - Initialize the cluster on the Kube Master server:
        - To run the requested command check file "bootsrap_cluster_kubemaster.sh"
- 🟤 Configuring Networking with Flannel
    - K8S supports a variety of networking solutions to provide networking between containers
    - Follow the file "configure_networking_flannel.sh"
